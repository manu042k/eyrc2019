e-Yantra is an initiative by IIT Bombay that gives the immense opportunity to engineering students to learn and hands on the robotics platform .There by solving the problems in society through robotics ,as well developing the skills of students .

e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) requires a team of four people ,irrespective of branch but of same college . This time we had took part in it, following is the process involved.

Each individual has to clear an amplitude test ,base on the scoring parameters and prerequisite knowledge on programming languages each teams will be allocated with a theme .“Construct-O-Bot” was the theme that we had to work on , this theme was designed to boast the work after natural disasters.
<br>Task 1
here we had to simulate the working in Vrep software ,a virtual model of FirebirdV and arena was built by them where we had to implement a line follower ,pick and place robot and a path planning algorithm.
<br>Task 2
It involved Printing theme arena on a flex sheet, and making of houses and materials
<br>Task 3
here we had to Study the theme Rulebook thoroughly which had the detailed description of the problem statement, arena design, theme rules and scoring parameters and Prepared a detailed document covering our understanding of the theme and approach towards solving the problem statement. Also, answered some questions pertaining to the theme.

Later we had to design, build robot and mechanism with the components provided to solve the problem.

A robotic kit would be sent to each team from NEX Robotics.
<br>Task 4
This task was to test implementation progress. Follow the link below to check out the video demonstration .
<br>Task 5
Implementation of complete solution to the Theme’s problem statement and submitting the video and well documented code.

we used Atmel studio 6 for coding Atmega2560 micro controller
